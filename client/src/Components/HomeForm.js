            This website was created to detail the experiences I had during my CO-OP work terms, starting 
            at the Co-operators (Guelph location). I spent my term working with the Build Automation and 
            Release (BAR) team where we were responsible for the automation of testing, release activities,
             and building/maintaining environments. My hope is by looking through this website, you will 
             learn more about the experiences and skills I gained throughout my Software Engineering CO-OP 
             program at the University of Guelph. To learn more about my first and second work term at The 
             Co-operators, click the button below.</p> <br></br>
